<li>NOTE: Remove Poolish from frig 30 to 45 min to bring to room temperature. In a large bowl, add the Poolish, flour and all of the salt. IMPORANT: Add water a little at a time. DO NOT add all at once. Flour needs to absorb water little by little before adding more.</li>
<li>Using a Kitchenaid stand mixer with dough hook, mix for 8 to 10 minutes; or hand knead for 10+ mins---dough will be sticky but together. </li>
<li>Remove bowl and keeping top on top always, using bench scraper work dough with hands kinda like a big ball, with fingers underneath lifting dough off board, repeat.  etc. </li>
