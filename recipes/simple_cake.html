<p>Description: Very nice cake, highly recommended!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>¾ cup vegetable oil, plus more for pan</li>
    <li>1⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1¼ cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1¾ tsp. baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ tsp. baking soda</li>
    <li>1½ tsp. kosher salt, divided</li>
    <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1¾ tsp. vanilla extract, divided</li>
    <li>4 oz. semisweet chocolate chips or coarsely chopped chocolate bars (do not exceed 64% cacao)</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>4 oz. cream cheese, room temperature</li>
    <li>¼ cup powdered sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 325°. Using your fingertips, grease bottom and sides of a 9" round cake pan with vegetable oil. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper, smoothing to eliminate air bubbles. (It may sound fancy, but making a parchment circle is easy! Place pan on a piece of parchment, trace circumference with a pencil, then cut it out.)</li>
<li>Whisk 1⅓ cups all-purpose flour, 1¼ cups granulated sugar, 1¾ tsp. baking powder, ¼ tsp. baking soda, and 1¼ tsp. kosher salt in a large bowl. Sift ½ cup cocoa powder into bowl, then whisk to combine. (You can stop here and package these dry ingredients in an airtight container to create a sort of DIY cake mix if you want!)</li>
<li>Whisk 2 large eggs, ¾ cup vegetable oil, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract in a medium bowl until well combined and creamy, about 30 seconds. Using a spatula, mix egg mixture into dry ingredients until fully incorporated. It will be thick and pasty, that’s okay!</li>
<li>Warm 1 cup milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it comes to just a bare simmer—make sure it doesn’t come to a boil. Whisk warmed milk into batter until lump-free and just combined; do not overmix.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
