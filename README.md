# odin-recipes
This is a readme file for my journey with The Odin Project. Let's see how far I get.
So far I learned the some basic skills, some of those I just refresh. But here we go with the list:
-Linux Command Line, Bash commands (cd, ls, mkdir, rm, touch, pwd, etc.)
-Git and Github basics
-HTML basics

That is all for now folks. I will update after this "Odin recipes" project is done.
